      %p We're not just a web design agency. We're not just a graphic design firm. We're not just coders, and we're not just artists. We're a team of T-shaped interaction designers and design strategists who help grow businesses. (Oh, and we're not just dudes with expensive chairs, either.)
      %p To get an idea of how we work, take a look at one of our extranet sites. It's a project we did for a nonprofit in 24 coffee-fueled hours.
